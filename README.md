# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

This repository contains the source for an AI-native textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics, developed using Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus. The project aims to provide a comprehensive learning resource for students to understand, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots.

## Project Deliverables

1.  **AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation**: The textbook is built using Docusaurus and deployed to GitHub Pages, following a Spec-Driven Development (SDD) approach.
2.  **Integrated RAG Chatbot**: An embedded Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot provides interactive learning, answering questions about the book's content. It leverages OpenAI Agents/ChatKit SDKs, FastAPI, Neon Serverless Postgres, and Qdrant Cloud.
3.  **Optional Bonus Features**:
    *   Reusable intelligence via Claude Code Subagents and Agent Skills.
    *   User Signup and Signin with [Better-Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/) for personalized content.
    *   Content personalization and Urdu translation for logged-in users.

## Course Overview

The textbook covers:
*   ROS 2 (Robot Operating System) Fundamentals
*   Robot Simulation with Gazebo & Unity
*   NVIDIA Isaac Platform for advanced perception and training
*   Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for integrating LLMs and Robotics

## Development Philosophy

This project adheres to the principles outlined in the `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, emphasizing AI/Spec-Driven Development, modular architecture, user-centric design, and continuous integration.
