## Prompt

$ARGUMENTS

## Response snapshot

The `tasks.md` file for "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook" has been successfully generated and is located at `/home/wasi/Desktop/ai-native-hackathon/specs/001-physical-ai-robotics-textbook/tasks.md`.

Summary of Tasks:
*   Total Tasks: 53
*   Tasks by Phase/User Story:
    *   Phase 1: Setup (8 tasks)
    *   Phase 2: Foundational (6 tasks)
    *   Phase 3: User Story 1 - Core Textbook Content (8 tasks)
    *   Phase 4: User Story 2 - Integrated RAG Chatbot (7 tasks)
    *   Phase 5: User Story 3 - User Authentication & Personalization (7 tasks)
    *   Phase 6: User Story 4 - Content Personalization (5 tasks)
    *   Phase 7: User Story 5 - Urdu Translation (5 tasks)
    *   Phase 8: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns (7 tasks)
*   Parallel Opportunities: Many tasks are marked `[P]` and can be executed concurrently to optimize development time.
*   Independent Test Criteria: Each user story phase includes a clear independent test criterion.
*   Suggested MVP Scope: User Story 1 (Core Textbook Content) and User Story 2 (Integrated RAG Chatbot) form the Minimum Viable Product.

You can now proceed with implementing these tasks. Before that, I will create a PHR for this task generation.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Detailed task list generated, organized by user stories and phases, for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook project.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: `tasks.md` created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: User will likely proceed with implementation (`/sp.implement`).
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully translated the plan into a detailed task list, organized by user stories, ensuring each task is specific, actionable, and includes relevant file paths, following the specified format.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
